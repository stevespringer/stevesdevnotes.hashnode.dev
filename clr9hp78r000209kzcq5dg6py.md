While modern banks have excellent financial reporting facilities, some old ones provide little more than regular pdf statements.

A client came to me after the one csv export that their bank provided was rendered useless by almost every transaction description being removed or redacted, apparently for data protection reasons.

Despite there being simple ways to derive tabular data from PDF documents ([see part 2](https://stevesdevnotes.hashnode.dev/extracting-pdf-statements-from-your-gmail-inbox)), a slightly more sophisticated approach was needed here.

In this instance, the table was structured so that it was impossible to tell if a monetary amount was a debit or credit without knowing it's horizontal position on the page.

As I mentioned in [part 1](https://stevesdevnotes.hashnode.dev/mining-pdfs-for-tabular-data-part-1), there are technical ways to fine-tune table-extraction, and that's what we'll be needing now.

Using [pdfplumber's](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) `extract_words` function, it's possible to find certain "anchor" words, such as those in the table header, to obtain horizontal positions that you can explicitly pass to the table-extraction functions.

I also found that, by focussing in on only the table via the `page.crop` funciton, I could perform `extract_words` on the crop to deduce the positions of every row, even if some rows spanned multiple lines.

Like in [part 2](https://stevesdevnotes.hashnode.dev/extracting-pdf-statements-from-your-gmail-inbox), I used Google Colab to conveniently traverse a folder full of documents and produce a single export containing every transaction.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Pro tip: If the document supplies one or more headline "summary" figures, use these to check against the sum total of the values that you extracted, to ensure the correctness of your parsing code.</div>
</div>

Below is an example of how this kind of task can be approached:
